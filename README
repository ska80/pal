PAL (Pixel Art Library) -- a portable graphics/sound library for Common Lisp

PAL is a portable graphics/sound library mainly intended for creating modern
2d games (yes, they do still exist) with Common Lisp. Altough it is built on
top of SDL and OpenGL it is not just a wrapper for those but provides an easy
to use, higher level API that doesn't require any knowledge of the underlying
libraries. So, if you want a full SDL or OpenGL bindings you might want to
look here or here.

Pixel Art Library uses CFFI to interface with the native libraries and it
should work with all Common Lisps that fully support it. It is mostly tested
on SBCL and CLisp on Windows and Linux.
