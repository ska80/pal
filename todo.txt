TODO:

- Add align, scale and angle options to DRAW-IMAGE*.

- Implement image mirroring, tiles and animation.

- Box/box/line/circle etc. overlap functions, faster v-dist.

- Correct aspect ratio when fullscreen on widescreen displays.

- I would really like to see it run on OS X.

- Documentation and tutorials.



As separate projects on top of PAL:

- Native CL font resource builder

- TTF support

- Some sort of sprite library?

- Network code?
