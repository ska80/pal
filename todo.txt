TODO:


For v1.1

- Fix offsets in draw-image.

- Polygon smooth hint?

- Add align, scale and angle options to DRAW-IMAGE*.

- Better clipping.

- Structured color values.



After v1.1

- Better drawing primitives, real lines, start/end args to draw-circle etc.

- As always, optimise GL state handling.

- Implement image mirroring, tiles and animation.

- Box/box/line/circle etc. overlap functions, faster v-dist.

- Correct aspect ratio when fullscreen on widescreen displays.

- I would really like to see it run on OS X.

- Documentation and tutorials.



As separate projects on top of PAL:

- GUI, work in progress.

- Native CL font resource builder.

- TTF support.

- Some sort of sprite library?

- Network code?
