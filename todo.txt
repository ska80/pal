TODO:

- Add align, scale and angle options to DRAW-IMAGE*.

- Implement image mirroring.

- Image tiles and animation.

- Box/box/line/circle etc. overlap functions, faster v-dist.

- Improved texture handling.

- Fix the FPS limiter, the results could be a lot smoother.

- Correct aspect ratio when fullscreen on widescreen displays.

As separate projects on top of PAL:
