TODO:

- Add display list support.

- Font rendering is too slow, maybe use display lists for that?

- More drawing primitives.

- image-from-array/image-to-array/screen-to-array etc.

- Fix the FPS limiter, the results could be a lot smoother.

- Check the sanity of vector.lisp and add some operations, esp. bounding-boxes
  etc.

- Correct aspect ratio when fullscreen on widescreen displays.

- I would really like to see it run on OS X.

- Simple and transparent animation system for images.

- Using fullscreen mode on Windows some times results in screen flickering
  between desktop and PAL screen, usually fixed by alt-tabbing. Should be fixed.

- The problems with Linux and some gfx drivers should be somehow fixed.

- Documentation and tutorials.



As separate projects on top of PAL:

- Native CL font resource builder

- TTF support

- GUI

- Some sort of sprite library?

- Network code?
